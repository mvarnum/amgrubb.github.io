	title = {A Preliminary Investigation of the Utility of Goal Model Construction},
	abstract = {Goal models have long been used in the literature to model and reason about stakeholders' intentions. Prior work proposed several studies aimed at investigating what utility stakeholders derive from constructing and analyzing goal models. We designed and conducted an initial empirical study that explores the construction stage of goal modeling, asking whether stakeholders benefit from manually drawing their model. We recruited eight qualified participants and asked each to create a goal model for a decision they were considering, while talking out loud. Half of the participants in this study used {BloomingLeaf}, while the remaining participants drew goal models by hand. Using information gathered through an online pre-study questionnaire, we constructed a goal model for each participant. Participants compared our generated models with their manually created ones. We used open coding to find themes and categories for qualitative responses. Analysis showed participants preferred their own model to the researcher generated one. The results of which have implications for future studies, as well as goal model adoption and automation.},

	title = {Towards an Evaluation Visualization with Color},
	abstract = {Goal models help stakeholders understand project scenarios and make decisions. In prior work, we used Tropos evaluation semantics to allow for automated analysis over time; however, formal evaluation labels (e.g., (F, bottom)) are difficult for users to interpret across a large model. In this paper, we present our work towards understanding the extent to which using colors in goal modeling affects users' ability to make decisions. Specifically, we are interested in studying if coloring intentions with evaluation information allows for better comparisons of initial states and simulations of future paths. To address this question, we developed a color visualization extension to {BloomingLeaf}, a goal model analysis tool, where the color of each node is changed based on either the initial evaluations or the resulting analysis over time. This then allows us to explore if and how color visualization assists the user with decision making. We present our implementation and initial evaluation of this extension.},

	title = {Towards a General Solution for Layout of Visual Goal Models with Actors},
	abstract = {Goal models help stakeholders make trade-off decisions in the early stages of project development. While these approaches have significant analysis capabilities, they have yet to see broad industrial adoption, with the construction of scalable large realistic goal models acting as a significant barrier. Over the last decade, researchers have used force-directed algorithms, specifically {GraphViz}, to layout goal models and have called for improved layout algorithms to better accommodate the unique challenges presented by actor-based models. We extend a forcedirected algorithm to include goal model heuristics, and independently arrived at a domain specific version of a generic layout algorithm for undirected compound graphs. As initial validation of the effectiveness and scalability of our algorithm, we implement our approach in {AnonymousTool}, a goal model analysis tool. Initial results are promising; yet, further collaboration andvalidation across the various goal modeling approaches (e.g., {GRL}, {iStar}, Tropos) is  equired before we can recommend ourapproach to be adopted in tooling. This paper presents early results and lays a foundation for discussion within our {GORE} community},

	abstract = {Goal models are used in early phase requirements engineering to elicit stakeholders' intentions, analyze dependencies, and help stakeholders make trade-off decisions about the project and its interaction with the environment. The Evolving Intentions  framework extended goal model analysis to evaluate how models change over time, by creating simulation paths showing possible evolutions of the model. More recently, we extended this analysis to allow users to explore states along the path and generate their own simulation paths. However, this approach is limited by users ability to comprehend the state space, which grows exponentially with the size of the model. In this paper, we explore using filters to reduce the number of viewable solutions enabling users to create their own simulation results. We present our approach and initial validation, including an analysis of prior models and a review of expert feedback.},

	abstract = {Goal models have long been used in academia without wide spread adoption in industry. If the fundamental purpose of goal models is to allow stakeholders to generate scenarios and ask “what if” questions, then which parts of the process of model construction, analysis, and evolution benefit from and which are hindered by manual activities? The recent expansion of goal modelling to ask time-based questions further amplifies this issue because significant additional information is required from stakeholders. Through a series of empirical studies, we aim to isolate the processes of model construction, analysis, and evolution for the purpose of studying the utility of goal-oriented requirements engineering approaches and exploring which tasks are essential practices that stakeholders must complete themselves to gain modeling benefit, and which tasks can be simplified through automation. In this process, we will also measure the benefits of completing relevant goal modelling activities with and without timing analysis. In this short communication, we describe our objectives for understanding the benefits of and barriers to goal-oriented requirements engineering.},

Despite the proliferation of tools, new tools keep being built, taking resources and time and possibly "reinventing the wheel" in terms of tool functionality. To gain an in-depth understanding of this situation, we are interested in the challenges and tradeoffs in creating {iStar} tools. In this paper, we examine three diverse tools as case studies, illustrating the challenges and tradeoffs from the developer's perspective. Based on such studies, we establish a goal model to capture the collected knowledge, which can help researchers to make informed decisions and optimize their tool development.},

Goal model analysis helps stakeholders answer "what if" questions enabling them to make tradeoff decisions about their project requirements. However, questions concerning the evolution over time of stakeholder requirements or changes in actor intentionality are not explicitly addressed by current approaches. In this paper, we tackle this problem by presenting a method for specifying changes in intentions over time, and a technique that uses simulation for asking a variety of "what if" questions about such models. Using the development of a web-based modeling tool as an example, we demonstrate that this technique is effective for debugging goal models and answering stakeholder questions.},

	abstract = {Existing modeling approaches in requirements engineering assume that stakeholder goals are static: once set, they remain the same throughout the lifecycle of the project. Of course, such goals, like anything else, may change over time. In earlier work, we introduced Evolving Intentions: an approach that allows stakeholders to specify how evaluations of goal model elements change over time. Simulation over Evolving Intentions enables stakeholders to ask a variety of "what if" questions, and evaluate possible evolutions of a goal model. {GrowingLeaf} is a web-based tool that implements both the modeling and analysis components of this approach. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness and usability of Evolving Intentions, Simulation over Evolving Intentions, and {GrowingLeaf}. We report on a betweensubjects experiment we conducted with fifteen graduate students familiar with requirements engineering. Using qualitative, quantitative, and timing data, we show that Evolving Intentions were intuitive, that Simulation over Evolving Intentions increased the subjects' understanding and produced meaningful results, and that {GrowingLeaf} was found to be effective and usable.},
